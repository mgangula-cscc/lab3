# Docker security homework


For this homework, you should create a [report.md](report.md) file containing [Github-style markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

The contents of your [report.md](report.md) should be a report on an aspect of Docker security that you research.  You can look for Docker vulnerabilities in the news, read a Docker security article, a security related blog discussing Docker, etc.

Your report should contain:
* A link to the source material you are reporting on
* A brief (1-2 paragraph) summary of the source material, in your own words
* Key takeaways based on your reading
* Answer the following:
  + Was the security practice or vulnerability you researched particular to Docker, or not?
  + Was the security practice or vulnerability related to the core docker system itself, the extended environment (e.g. Docker Hub), or Docker images (a.k.a. the software inside the Docker image)? 
  + Is this something that you should be concerned about within your particular company?
